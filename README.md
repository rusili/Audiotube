# Audiotube

A side project that stemmed from the Android Youtube player not being able to play in the background or while the screen is turned off.
Originally worked in February 2017, but when I came back to it in March, I believe Google has patched the ability to put their YoutubePlayer object in a service to play when the screen is off.
